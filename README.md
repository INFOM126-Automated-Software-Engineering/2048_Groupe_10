# 2048

## Description
2048 is a simple yet addictive puzzle game. The objective is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them and create a tile with the number 2048. Each move introduces a new tile with a value of 2 or 4. The game ends when no more moves are possible.

## How to Play
There are three ways to play this game:

1. **Compile the code yourself**:
   - Make sure you have Maven installed.
   - Clone the GitHub repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/INFOM126-Automated-Software-Engineering/2048_Groupe_10.git
     ```
   - Navigate to the project directory:
     ```bash
     cd 2048_Groupe_10
     ```
   - Compile the project with Maven:
     ```bash
     mvn clean install
     ```
   - Run the game:
     ```bash
     java -jar target/2048-***.jar
     ```

2. **Download the .jar file**:
   - Go to the "Package" tab of this GitHub repository.
   - Download the `***.jar` file.
   - Run the game:
     ```bash
     java -jar 2048-***.jar
     ```

3. **Use the Docker scripts**:
   - Make sure you have Docker installed.
   - Clone the GitHub repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/INFOM126-Automated-Software-Engineering/2048_Groupe_10.git
     ```
   - Navigate to the project directory:
     ```bash
     cd 2048_Groupe_10/scripts
     ```
   - Run the script to install the Docker image and the X11 server for the GUI on macOS:
     ```bash
     ./Open_Docker_MacOS.sh
     ```
   - For Windows, run the PowerShell script:
     ```powershell
     ./Open_Docker_Windows.ps1
     ```
     
When containerizing a graphical application like 2048, the container itself does not handle graphical rendering. This is why an X11 server is needed on the host machine to redirect and display the graphical interface generated by the application running inside the container.

Enjoy playing 2048!
